# Exercises from the Programming Techniques laboratory.
## Warning. ⚠️
This problems were solved in my first years of faculty, they have not been verified and reviewed by any one. If you can provide any improvements like logic errors, code mistakes and so on, feel free to contact me or open a pull request by forking this repository.

I didn't review them and they were uploaded as i found in my old documents. In the future i will try to provide the problem statements, refactoring etc.

**I do not guarantee the correctness of the code!** ❌

## About the project. 🪴
### Purpose. 🎯
The purpose of this programs is to test the ability to solve problems that consist in the basics of working with: 📚
```sh
- arithmetics operators
- characters and strings
- conditional instructions
- dynamic allocation
- enums and base transformation
- functions and recursion
- harder problems
- pointers arithmetics
- structures and allocation
- variables display, reading and writing from keyboard
- vectors, matrix, pointers and vector basic algorithms
```

### Built With. ⚒️
The programs can be build with C or C++ compilers.

## Getting Started. 🚀
### System requirements ✅
- Operating System: MacOS, Windows, Linux(Ubuntu for example), Windows Subsystem for Linux. (WSL)
- Programming Language: C
- Code Editor: Visual Studio Code 

I used WSL as operating system, VSCode as code editor and to compile the code i made use of gcc compiler.

### Installation. 🪜
1. Install c/c++
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install build-essential
   ```

2. Compile from command line
   ```sh
   gcc -Wall app.c -o app
   ```
   
3. VSCode C/C++ extesion pack
   ```sh
   (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack)
   ```
   
4. Configure VSCode to run and debug C/C++ programs inside VSCode under WSL.
   ```sh

   ```
